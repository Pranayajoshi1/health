                <li>Less commonly, through blood transfusions and organ transplants with infected blood.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Early stage: Flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and fatigue (acute HIV infection).</li>
                <li>Chronic stage: Asymptomatic period where the virus is still active but reproduces at very low levels.</li>
                <li>Advanced stage (AIDS): Severe immune system damage, weight loss, chronic diarrhea, night sweats, and opportunistic infections like tuberculosis and certain cancers.</li>

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage the virus, keep the immune system functioning, and reduce the viral load to undetectable levels.</li>
                <li>Regular medical check-ups and blood tests to monitor health and treatment effectiveness.</li>
