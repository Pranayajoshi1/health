            <li>  <b>Example: </b>Believing in your partner's honesty and feeling secure in the relationship. Trust involves being reliable, keeping promises, and maintaining confidentiality.

            </ul>
            <br>
<h3> Open Communication:</h3>

<br>
                    <h3> Support:</h3>

                    <li> <b>Example: </b> Motivating your partner to achieve their goals and being there in times of need. Support can be shown through acts of kindness, words of encouragement, and simply being present when your partner needs you.</li>

    <center> <h3>2. Signs of an Unhealthy Relationship </h3></center>
    <h3> Open Communication:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Behavior</b>Disregarding your partner’s feelings or opinions. Lack of respect can manifest in belittling, mocking, or ignoring your partner's needs and preferences.</li>
    <li> <b>Example: </b> Making derogatory comments or dismissing their input. This behavior erodes self-esteem and creates an atmosphere of contempt and resentment.</li>
    <br>  
    <h3> Control Issues:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Behavior:</b>One partner exerts power over the other’s actions, decisions, or social interactions. Control issues can involve monitoring your partner’s movements, dictating their behavior, and isolating them from friends and family.</li>
    <li> <b>Example: </b> Monitoring your partner’s phone or dictating who they can see. Such behavior restricts personal freedom and fosters dependency and fear.</li> <h3> Poor Communication:</h3> <ul>
    <li> <b>Definition:</b>Avoiding difficult conversations or using aggression instead of constructive dialogue. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, unresolved conflicts, and emotional distance.</li>
    <li> <b>Example: </b> Yelling or giving the silent treatment instead of discussing issues. These actions prevent healthy resolution of conflicts and create a toxic environment.</li>
    <br> 
    <h3>Lack of Support:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>Definition:</b>Ignoring your partner’s needs or belittling their achievements. Lack of support can make your partner feel undervalued and isolated.</li>
    <li> <b>Example: </b> Mocking your partner’s career goals or not being there during tough times. This behavior undermines confidence and erodes trust in the relationship.</li>
